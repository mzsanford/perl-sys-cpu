=head1 NAME

Sys::CPU - Perl extension for getting CPU information. Currently only number of CPU's supported.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Sys::CPU;
  
  $number_of_cpus = Sys::CPU::cpu_count();
  printf("I have %d CPU's\n",$number_of_cpus);
  print "  Speed : ",Sys::CPU::cpu_clock(),"\n";
  print "  Type  : ",Sys::CPU::cpu_type(),"\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In responce to a post on perlmonks.org, a module for counting the number of CPU's on a 
system. Support has now also been added for type of CPU and clock speed. While much of the
code is from UNIX::Processors, win32 support has been added (but not tested).

v0.45 - Corrected solaris support (Thanks Cloyce)
